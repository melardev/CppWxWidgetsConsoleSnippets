# Introduction
I publish some of my wxWidgets Console(IO/Concurrency,Text processing, Process management) Snippets, I have others, not refactored enough to be published,
but I will publish them as soon as they have a good shape.

# Getting started
This project was created with Visual Studio and using wxWidgets installed by vcpkg which I strongly
recommend, it will download wxWidgets for you, and build it on your system, and make Visual Studio to
detect it automatically without any additional configuration.
Vcpkg in case you don't know is an awesome cross platform C++ package manager.
